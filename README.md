**Functions Implemented:**  
```print_vector```: Prints the elements of a vector in a formatted manner.  
```isprime```: Determines if a given integer is a prime number.  
```factorize```: Finds all positive factors of a given integer.  
```prime_factorize```: Computes the prime factorization of a given integer.  
```print_pascals_triangle```: Generates and prints the first n rows of Pascalâ€™s Triangle.  
**Test Functions:**
All test functions are already inside the main function. Please call the corresponding function for testing.
